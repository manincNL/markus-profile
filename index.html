              <li>As Engineering Manager, I lead six cross-functional engineering teams across two strategic domains, with full HR and performance responsibility for 48 engineers. I focus on attracting, developing, and retaining top talent through structured goal setting, coaching, and personal growth plans. My leadership fosters high-performing teams with a strong sense of ownership and accountability.</li>
            
              <li>I ensure the technical direction and delivery quality of our teams by embedding engineering standards, best practices, and continuous improvement processes. In close collaboration with architects and agile coaches, I challenge teams to raise the bar on reliability, scalability, and secure development — while maintaining velocity and focus.</li>
            
              <li>At the strategic level, I contribute to the domain management teams, where I help shape and operationalize OKRs at both team and domain level.

              <li>From January to August 2024, I played a key role in shaping the organization’s response to the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) by co-developing a unified testing standard and policy. My work focused on translating the final legal texts and articles of the regulation into actionable engineering guidelines. I identified and formalized the minimum requirements needed to align with DORA, ensuring both clarity and practical applicability across teams.</li>
            
              <li>As part of this effort, I designed a test approach model structured around five core pillars of operational resilience. Each pillar was elaborated into a set of concrete test approaches and minimum test expectations, enabling teams to operationalize regulatory goals without ambiguity. In addition, I contributed to the creation of a strategic testing policy, bridging regulatory compliance with engineering reality.</li>
            
              <li>Though I transitioned to a new role before formal delivery, the foundation I helped establish continues to support the organization’s alignment with DORA requirements in a consistent, scalable, and risk-based manner.</li>

Starting with MODX CMS and core HTML/CSS development, his early expertise led to multiple requests for assistance with both private and organizational web initiatives. Over time, he expanded his technical stack and delivered custom, responsive websites tailored to the needs of each audience. Throughout these projects, Markus developed a strong command of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, while also integrating dynamic components using PHP, jQuery, AngularJS, and Bootstrap. He consistently applied user-centered design principles and responsive techniques to ensure seamless performance across devices and screen sizes.

        <p>The internationally recognized certification for the Certified DevOps Essentials will help set the stage for organizational transformations in software development. DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations. This tool-agnostic certification helps to understand the principles and practices used within DevOps adoption throughout the journey. It will also serve as a base for future Certified DevOps trainings and certifications.</p>

        <p>This project involved setting up a professional personal website using the Hugo static site generator and the Toha theme. The journey began with configuring the core Hugo framework and customizing the Toha layout to match a unique personal branding style. After successfully running the site locally, the project transitioned to deploying the site via GitHub Pages. A key highlight was configuring a custom domain and linking it to the GitHub Pages deployment, ensuring the website could be served securely and reliably from a personal domain. The result is a fast, fully responsive website hosted on a version-controlled production branch — offering complete ownership of both the source code and the deployment process. This setup not only enhances professionalism but also enables continuous improvement and experimentation without vendor lock-in.</p>
