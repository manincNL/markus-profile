Lately, I’ve come across more and more people saying they won’t install solar panels — or worse, that they’re switching them off — because of the so-called feed-in penalty. And honestly, that frustrates me.

Not because I think everyone must have solar panels. But because this one change — a small adjustment in how feed-in energy is compensated — is being treated as if it wipes out the entire value of going solar. It doesn’t. Not even close.

I believe the feed-in tariff is not only reasonable — it’s necessary. And I say that as someone who generates their own energy, pays the fee, and still saves a significant amount. So let’s break this down properly.
