Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations. This tool-agnostic certification helps to understand the principles and practices used within DevOps adoption throughout the journey. It will also serve as a base for future Certified DevOps trainings and certifications.
