description: In today’s fast-moving tech landscape, tools and frameworks evolve at a pace that can leave even the best teams struggling to keep up. But high performance in engineering isn’t just about staying current with technology — it’s about building a culture where learning is embedded into the way teams think, collaborate, and grow. As an Engineering Manager, I’ve seen firsthand how fostering a culture of continuous learning isn’t a “nice to have” — it’s a strategic advantage. In this post, I’ll share what a true learning culture looks like, why it matters, and how you can start building one in your own team.

In today’s fast-moving tech landscape, tools and frameworks evolve at a pace that can leave even the best teams struggling to keep up. But high performance in engineering isn’t just about staying current with technology — it’s about building a culture where learning is embedded into the way teams think, collaborate, and grow. As an Engineering Manager, I’ve seen firsthand how fostering a culture of continuous learning isn’t a “nice to have” — it’s a strategic advantage. In this post, I’ll share what a true learning culture looks like, why it matters, and how you can start building one in your own team.

## What Is a Learning Culture?
A learning culture isn’t just about training budgets or access to online courses — it’s about intent. It’s a shared belief across a team or organization that learning is part of the job, not something you do off to the side when there's time. That intent shows up in how we work, collaborate, and support each other’s growth.

To me, learning means creating space for people to explore new skills, share knowledge, and feel safe doing so. It happens in pair programming sessions, in post-mortems where we openly reflect on failures, and in small moments where someone feels comfortable asking, “can you walk me through this?”

It also starts with leadership. If managers don’t model learning themselves — asking questions, sharing what they’re curious about, or admitting when they don’t know — teams won’t feel comfortable doing the same. A culture of growth is built from the top down and the bottom up.

Learning is also social. At a previous company, we used to come together every Friday to share what we’d been working on, ask for help, and invite feedback from customers. It became part of the rhythm — a natural part of the culture, not a special occasion.

Of course, teams are busy. We’re constantly shipping, fixing, planning. But a strong learning culture finds moments to pause and grow — even if it’s just once a month. At my current team, we do things like:

- Circus Days — two-day hackathons where the only goal is to build something fun and new.
- Learning Days — occasional team sessions focused on specific skills, often combined with a social event to keep things relaxed and human.
- Regular shared reviews where we reflect, teach, and look for ways to improve together.

Learning doesn’t just happen inside the team, either. It happens through feedback — from peers, from users, from systems that break. A team that listens and adapts is always learning.

And crucially, a learning culture is not just something leaders create — it’s something team members actively participate in. It takes ownership. The best cultures I’ve seen are filled with people who ask for feedback, start a brown-bag session without being asked, or share a failure story in standup. When people feel safe enough to take that space, learning becomes a collective rhythm — not a top-down initiative.

And finally, learning is how people grow — not just technically, but professionally. Whether someone wants to become a senior engineer, a tech lead, or a future founder, a learning culture gives them the confidence and opportunities to get there.

## What Gets in the Way of a Learning Culture?
If learning cultures are so valuable, why don’t more teams have them? In my experience, it’s rarely due to a lack of interest — most engineers want to grow. But there are some common friction points that get in the way:

1. Everyone’s Busy
Let’s be honest — most teams are under pressure to ship. Between sprint deadlines, production issues, and meetings, learning often gets pushed aside. It becomes a luxury rather than a priority. Without intentional space in the schedule, learning simply doesn’t happen.
2. Fear of Failure
If people don’t feel safe to experiment, ask questions, or admit they don’t know something — learning shuts down. A culture that punishes mistakes (even subtly) will never support growth. Psychological safety isn’t just a buzzword; it’s foundational.
3. Lack of Visibility or Permission
Even when people are learning, it’s not always recognized or valued. If your team only celebrates delivery and output, there’s no incentive to spend time sharing knowledge or exploring something new. People need both permission and encouragement to learn.
4. No Clear Ownership
Sometimes everyone assumes someone else will "bring the learning." Without clear ownership — both from leaders and individuals — learning initiatives fall through the cracks. It needs champions at every level.
5. Misunderstanding What Learning Looks Like
Learning doesn’t always mean formal training. Reading a blog post, reflecting on a mistake, asking a senior colleague for context — these are all valid forms. Teams that only value structured training miss out on the informal, everyday learning that really drives growth.

## What Can Engineering Managers Do to Foster a Learning Culture?
Creating a learning culture doesn’t require massive programs or endless budgets — it starts with small, intentional choices that signal to your team: learning is valued here.

Here are a few strategies that I’ve found effective:

1. Model It Yourself
Show curiosity. Admit when you don’t know. Talk openly about what you’re learning — whether it’s a technical concept, a leadership book, or a mistake you made. When leaders learn out loud, teams follow.

2. Make Learning Visible
Talk about learning in 1-on-1s, retros, and planning sessions. Celebrate when someone shares a new concept or reflects on a failure. Normalize that learning is part of success, not separate from it.

3. Design Opportunities Into the Workflow
Create recurring events where learning happens by default:

- Quarterly “Circus Days” to build something fun and new
- Monthly Learning Days with workshops or mini-sessions on requested topics
- Friday sharing rituals — demos, post-mortems, or knowledge cafés
- Invite team members to present at internal meetups or write dev blogs

4. Support, But Don’t Control
Provide space and encouragement, but don’t dictate how people must learn. Some will want to pair program, others will prefer solo deep-dives. Let people take ownership of their learning path — just make sure the door is open.

5. Reward Growth, Not Just Output
Promote people not only for shipping features but for mentoring others, improving documentation, or raising the team’s skill level. If growth is never recognized, people won’t prioritize it.

6. Protect Time
This might be the hardest part — but also the most important. Even if it’s just a few hours a month, protect time for learning the same way you protect time for delivery. Otherwise, it will always be the first thing to slip.
