              <li>As Engineering Manager, I lead six cross-functional engineering teams across two strategic domains, with full HR and performance responsibility for 48 engineers. I focus on attracting, developing, and retaining top talent through structured goal setting, coaching, and personal growth plans. My leadership fosters high-performing teams with a strong sense of ownership and accountability.</li>
            
              <li>I ensure the technical direction and delivery quality of our teams by embedding engineering standards, best practices, and continuous improvement processes. In close collaboration with architects and agile coaches, I challenge teams to raise the bar on reliability, scalability, and secure development — while maintaining velocity and focus.</li>
            
              <li>At the strategic level, I contribute to the domain management teams, where I help shape and operationalize OKRs at both team and domain level. I work closely with peer engineering managers to align on organizational goals, strengthen leadership capabilities, and create a unified culture of excellence, learning, and impact.</li>

              <li>From January to August 2024, I played a key role in shaping the organization’s response to the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) by co-developing a unified testing standard and policy. My work focused on translating the final legal texts and articles of the regulation into actionable engineering guidelines. I identified and formalized the minimum requirements needed to align with DORA, ensuring both clarity and practical applicability across teams.</li>
            
              <li>As part of this effort, I designed a test approach model structured around five core pillars of operational resilience. Each pillar was elaborated into a set of concrete test approaches and minimum test expectations, enabling teams to operationalize regulatory goals without ambiguity. In addition, I contributed to the creation of a strategic testing policy, bridging regulatory compliance with engineering reality.</li>
            
              <li>Though I transitioned to a new role before formal delivery, the foundation I helped establish continues to support the organization’s alignment with DORA requirements in a consistent, scalable, and risk-based manner.</li>

I’ve developed and facilitated sessions on both technical and leadership topics, tailored to the evolving needs of our engineering organization.</li>
            
              <li>As part of this, I co-organize and lead onboarding bootcamps for new engineers and engineering managers, ensuring a strong, aligned start within our culture and ways of working. I also mentor a trainee during her traineeship, supporting her personal and professional development through structured guidance and regular feedback.</li>

We defined and published reusable patterns and actionable how-tos (e.g., incident management with Splunk, log aggregation, CMDB hygiene) that were broadly applicable and implementation-ready.</li>
            
              <li>By collaborating hands-on with development teams, we demonstrated real-world impact (e.g., improved reliability through incident readiness and observability).

                <p class="quote">Markus has been an outright pragmatic coach; working with him was as pleasant as it was a learning experience. His relationship management, his way of providing independence to teams, his views on Agile metrics and his knowledge on agility is insightful. His training is pure joy. He is always a sport in challenging situations, very open minded and result oriented. He has a unique blend of Agile aspects and Delivery management. His simplistic approach to address any form of activity or problems ensured a solution is derived by the team itself. He has created a mark during the organizational transformation towards implementing Agile; indeed his experience, guidance and knowledge as an agile coach helped my team to reach a greater height in CICD journey in the organisation.</p>

                <p class="quote"><p>De afgelopen twee jaren heb ik intensief samengewerkt met Markus. In eerste instantie als analist en DEVOPS engineer met als doel bijhouden van de bestaande User Access applicatie en kort later voor de opzet van de nieuwe applicatie. In die tijd heb ik gemerkt dat Markus een vrolijke kant en een zeer serieuze kant hee. Vrolijk bij binnenkomst en als hij merkt dat de spanning wat te hoog wordt binnen het team.</p>
<p>Serieus als er problemen zijn of als de schouders eronder gezet moeten worden.</p>
<p>Als tweede hebben we gemerkt dat Markus een natuurlijk leiderschap over zicht hee. Na verloop van een aantal maanden hebben we gevraagd of hij scrummaster wilde worden. Op dat moment laat Marcus ook duidelijk zien dat hij een extra verantwoordelijkheid op zich kan nemen. Duidelijk in de lead, trekt en duwt hij aan zijn teamleden om er voor te zorgen dat de opdrachten die er zijn, ook goed worden afgerond. Als tweede ook tijdelijk als Product owner. Hierbij waren het niet alleen de teamleden, maar ook meerdere teams die betrokken werden. Tevens de afstemmingen met de diverse stakeholders. Niet helemaal van een leien dakje, maar daarvoor was de druk m.b.t. oplevering ook te hoog.</p>
<p>Al met al vind ik Markus een allrounder, die zoals ik hierboven al schrijf, op vele vlakken in te zetten is. Markus is niet alleen een harde werker maar ook een fijn mens en prettig om mee te sparren.”</p>

        <p>Since 2011, Markus has been actively involved in designing, developing, and maintaining a variety of websites for different projects and stakeholders. Starting with MODX CMS and core HTML/CSS development, his early expertise led to multiple requests for assistance with both private and organizational web initiatives. Over time, he expanded his technical stack and delivered custom, responsive websites tailored to the needs of each audience. Throughout these projects, Markus developed a strong command of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, while also integrating dynamic components using PHP, jQuery, AngularJS, and Bootstrap. He consistently applied user-centered design principles and responsive techniques to ensure seamless performance across devices and screen sizes. His contributions reflect a balanced focus on front-end interactivity and maintainable code structures within content management systems.</p>

        <p>The internationally recognized certification for the Certified DevOps Essentials will help set the stage for organizational transformations in software development. DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations. This tool-agnostic certification helps to understand the principles and practices used within DevOps adoption throughout the journey. It will also serve as a base for future Certified DevOps trainings and certifications.</p>

        <p>This project involved setting up a professional personal website using the Hugo static site generator and the Toha theme. The journey began with configuring the core Hugo framework and customizing the Toha layout to match a unique personal branding style. After successfully running the site locally, the project transitioned to deploying the site via GitHub Pages. A key highlight was configuring a custom domain and linking it to the GitHub Pages deployment, ensuring the website could be served securely and reliably from a personal domain. The result is a fast, fully responsive website hosted on a version-controlled production branch — offering complete ownership of both the source code and the deployment process. This setup not only enhances professionalism but also enables continuous improvement and experimentation without vendor lock-in.</p>
