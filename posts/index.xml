      <title>Don’t Switch Off Your Panels — You’re Missing the Point</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve come across more and more people saying they won’t install solar panels — or worse, that they’re switching them off — because of the so-called feed-in penalty. And honestly, that frustrates me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not because I think everyone must have solar panels. But because this one change — a small adjustment in how feed-in energy is compensated — is being treated as if it wipes out the entire value of going solar. It doesn’t. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Still Going Solar: A Personal Case for Energy Independence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a recent episode of the Bright podcast, someone said it:
“Solar panels are becoming something for nerds again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? I kind of agree. With net metering being phased out and electricity markets becoming more complex, solar isn’t just plug-and-play anymore. It takes research. Curiosity. A bit of obsession with graphs and peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than that turning me off — it’s exactly why I’m continuing to invest. Over the past few years, I’ve gone from hybrid driving to full electric, installed solar panels in 2023, switched to a dynamic energy contract in 2025, and now I’m adding a home battery to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Learning Cultures Are the Key to High-Performing Engineering Teams</title>
      <link>https://markusvanduijn.nl/posts/learning-culture/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s fast-moving tech landscape, tools and frameworks evolve at a pace that can leave even the best teams struggling to keep up. But high performance in engineering isn’t just about staying current with technology — it’s about building a culture where learning is embedded into the way teams think, collaborate, and grow. As an Engineering Manager, I’ve seen firsthand how fostering a culture of continuous learning isn’t a “nice to have” — it’s a strategic advantage. In this post, I’ll share what a true learning culture looks like, why it matters, and how you can start building one in your own team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
