- name: Hugo Resume Project – Personal Site with Full Code Ownership
  logo: /images/sections/projects/toha.png
  role: Builder
  timeline: "Jun 2019 - Present"
  repo: https://github.com/manincNL/markus-profile
  summary: "This project involved setting up a professional personal website using the Hugo static site generator and the Toha theme. The journey began with configuring the core Hugo framework and customizing the Toha layout to match a unique personal branding style. After successfully running the site locally, the project transitioned to deploying the site via GitHub Pages. A key highlight was configuring a custom domain and linking it to the GitHub Pages deployment, ensuring the website could be served securely and reliably from a personal domain. The result is a fast, fully responsive website hosted on a version-controlled production branch — offering complete ownership of both the source code and the deployment process. This setup not only enhances professionalism but also enables continuous improvement and experimentation without vendor lock-in."
